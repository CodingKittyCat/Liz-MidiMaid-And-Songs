## 💡 What is The MIDI Maid?

**The MIDI Maid** is a charming little command-line helper designed to clean, tidy, and prep your MIDI files for use in things like *Final Fantasy XIV* performances.  
She sweeps up cluttered notes, gently remaps pitch ranges, and ensures everything sounds lovely for your in-game concerts!
Maids, however, aren't miracle beings! It'll still require some fine tuning here and there to create the perfect track. However, you should be well on your way with the MidiMaid :)

## 🧹 How Does It Work?

It's super simple! Once you open the program, The MIDI Maid will guide you through her cleaning ritual, one dainty step at a time:

---

### 🪞 Step 1: Select Your MIDI File  
When prompted, a file picker will magically appear!  
Just select the `.mid` file you want The Maid to work on.  

---

### 🧺 Step 2: Choose a Destination Folder  
Next, she'll ask where you want to save the cleaned-up version.  
A folder picker will appear – pick your favorite tidy space!

---

### 📑 Step 3: View the Tracks  
You'll see a list of tracks inside your MIDI file, along with their note counts.  
Each track has an index number like `[0]`, `[1]`, etc.

---

### ✨ Step 4: Pick a Cleaning Mode

Choose how you want The Maid to help:

```
[1] Declutter and Remap – Trim messy chords, fit to FFXIV play range (C3–C6)
[2] Just Remap – Gently shift all notes into C3–C6
[3] Just Declutter – Trim chords and clutter without changing pitches
[4] Remap with Preserved Keys – Advanced option to retain musical key
[5] Declutter then Remap with Key Awareness – Combo cleaning!
```

Just enter the number you like! 💕

### 🎻 Step 5: Select Tracks to Clean

Want to clean everything?  
Type:

```
all
```

Only want specific tracks?  
Type their numbers, like:

```
0, 1
```

The Maid will handle the rest with poise and grace 🌟

## 🍰 Output

Once she’s finished tidying, you’ll find a polished new file saved in your chosen folder, with a lovely name like:

```

```

Now it’s ready to perform — no clutter, no out-of-range notes, just magic!
